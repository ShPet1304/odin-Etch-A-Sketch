## 🧐 About The Project
The goal of this project was to create a digital "Etch-a-Sketch" using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It involves creating a grid of square `divs` that change color when the mouse hovers over them.

### ✨ Features
* **Dynamic Grid:** Users can select a canvas size (e.g., 16x16, 64x64) via a prompt.
* **Drawing:** Hovering over the grid cells leaves a pixel trail.
* **Reset:** A button to clear the screen and resize the grid.
* **Rainbow Mode:** Randomizes the color of each pixel.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Flexbox)
* **JavaScript** (ES6+)

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project was a deep dive into **DOM Manipulation**. Some specific learning points include:

* Creating HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript (`document.createElement`).
* Attaching Event Listeners (`mouseover`, `click`) to interact with the DOM.
* Using Flexbox to center the grid and ensure the layout remains responsive.
* Math logic to calculate the width/height of squares based on the user's input size.
